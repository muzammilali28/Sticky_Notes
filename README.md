# About the Project

This is a React Js project that currently uses the [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) package as a `dummy backend server`.<br>
This Project covers almost all the core concepts of React framework such as ***React Hooks, Components, Props, etc***

## How to Run

Go in the [ReactApp/src](https://github.com/muzammilali28/Sticky_Notes/tree/master/StickyNotes/src) folder and Open it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).<br>
Then Open **Two Terminals** and write the following in each terminal.<br>
First run `npm run server` in one terminal and then after that `npm run start` in the other terminal.

**Note : You can look at the [package.json](https://github.com/muzammilali28/Sticky_Notes/blob/master/StickyNotes/package.json) file to see whats going on in their**

Website is Running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
The Server is Running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/notes)

Enjoy!

## Later Updates

I will be adding a Node + [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) backend actual server later on in this project.

***So keep your self updated!!***
